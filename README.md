# The Fireside Library - C# Edition

Welcome to the library - this application serves as a tool to keep track of your books by storing them in your own personal satchel.
You are able to retrieve books from a specified library as well, and return them back to the library when finished borrowing.

## Directions
In the project's current state, you are given simple instructions to add a book with a title, author first/last name and page amount.
After that, you will be able to view your created book in the library. Additionally, it will be added to your satchel for later use.

- Note: In version 1.0, an interface will be provided to the user with multiple options including adding/deleting books to a library and checking
out/checking in books from the library to your personal satchel. You will also be able to view every book in stock.

## Project Details
This project was created over the course of 7-8 hours (in its current state). It heavily utilizes Interfaces (for creating bag/library methods)
as well as lists and dictionaries to store your books as needed.
